abstract = {In machine learning, the model is not as complicated as possible. Good generalization ability means that the model not only performs well on the training data set, but also can make good prediction on new data. Regularization imposes a penalty on model’s complexity or smoothness, allowing for good generalization to unseen data even when training on a finite training set or with an inadequate iteration. Deep learning has developed rapidly in recent years. Then the regularization has a broader definition: regularization is a technology aimed at improving the generalization ability of a model. This paper gave a comprehensive study and a state-of-the-art review of the regularization strategies in machine learning. Then the characteristics and comparisons of regularizations were presented. In addition, it discussed how to choose a regularization for the specific task. For specific tasks, it is necessary for regularization technology to have good mathematical characteristics. Meanwhile, new regularization techniques can be constructed by extending and combining existing regularization techniques. Finally, it concluded current opportunities and challenges of regularization technologies, as well as many open concerns and research trends.}

  abstract  = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.}

%complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)

The aims of this study were therefore to determine the prevalence and reasons for use of CAM during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among a representative sample of the Norwegian population, and further determine self-reported effects and adverse effects of the CAM modalities used. 

Most used were natural remedies and dietary supplement (57%, mainly vitamins and minerals), but self-help practices like yoga and meditation were also widely used (24%).
